## Project overview
`gold_project` is a Flutter mobile application targeted at shopkeepers for managing purchases of jewellery from wholesalers. The repository is primarily Dart (Flutter) based according to GitHub language statistics.

This README provides a clear onboarding guide for developers who want to run, test, or contribute to the project.

## Key features (inferred)
> The repository's top-level README mentions it is for shopkeepers to purchase jewellery from wholesalers. The codebase appears to be a Flutter app scaffold. The list below is a suggested set of features commonly found in such apps — mark which apply after you confirm or point me to the implementing files:

- Product catalog (list of jewellery items)
- Search & filters for products
- Product details screen
- Cart and checkout flow
- Order history and tracking
- Authentication (shopkeeper accounts)
- Local persistence (SQLite / shared_preferences) or remote backend calls to an API
- Image assets and icons for the UI


## Tech stack
- Flutter (Dart)
- Android targets
- Potential backend integration (REST API) — check `lib/services` or network client files for base URLs and endpoints


## Folder structure (recommended / high-level)

```

## Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (stable channel). Recommended version: run `flutter --version` to confirm.
- Android Studio or VS Code (for running/emulating)
- A physical device or emulator


## Installation
1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trozen04/sanghi_project_volvrit.git
cd sanghi_project_volvrit
```

2. Get packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app (Android):

```bash
flutter run
```

Or open the project in Android Studio / VS Code and run.


## Environment & configuration
- Look for `APIConstants` file that contains API base URLs and keys.


## Building release
- Android (APK / AAB):

```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or
flutter build appbundle --release
```
```

Follow Flutter docs for code signing and provisioning profiles for iOS.



## Troubleshooting (common problems)
- `MissingPluginException` after creating build: run `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get`.
- Dart analysis issues: run `flutter analyze` and address static warnings.
- Assets not found: confirm `pubspec.yaml` has the `assets:` entries and run `flutter pub get`.


## Contributing
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit changes & open a PR.

Please add details about code style and testing expectations (e.g., prefer Provider/GetX/Bloc, lint rules) — I can add a CONTRIBUTING.md if you want.


## License
Add a license file (e.g., MIT) if you want the project to be open-source. Example:

## Next steps / How I can help further
- I created this README draft based on the repository's top-level info and standard Flutter project conventions.
- If you want a fully accurate README that lists:
  - exact dependencies & versions (from `pubspec.yaml`),
  - app entry point (`lib/main.dart`) notes and environment constants,
  - screenshots and sample API endpoints,
  - build badges and CI instructions,
